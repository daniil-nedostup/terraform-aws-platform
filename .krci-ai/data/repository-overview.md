# Terraform AWS Platform Repository Overview

## Purpose

This repository contains Terraform code for deploying and managing AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) clusters and their supporting infrastructure. It provides a standardized, repeatable approach to creating production-ready Kubernetes environments on AWS with best practices for security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

## Core Principles

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All AWS resources are defined and managed as code, enabling version control, peer review, and automated testing.
2. **Modularity**: The codebase is organized into logical modules (vpc, eks, iam, etc.) that can be deployed independently or together.
3. **Security First**: Security best practices are implemented throughout, including proper IAM roles, network security, and encryption.
4. **Cost Optimization**: The default configurations include cost-saving measures like spot instances, autoscaling, and scheduled scaling.
5. **Flexibility**: Parameterized configurations allow for customization without modifying the core code.

## Key Features

- EKS cluster deployment with best practices
- VPC creation with public and private subnets
- IAM role configuration for proper permissions
- S3 backend for Terraform state management
- Support for Argo CD integration
- AWS Load Balancer integration
- Security components including encryption and access controls
- Cost-effective resource configurations

## Target Use Cases

- Production, staging, and development Kubernetes environments
- Multi-team Kubernetes platforms
- DevOps pipeline integration
- Containerized application hosting

## Integration with KubeRocketCI

This repository serves as the foundation for deploying Kubernetes infrastructure that can be further enhanced with KubeRocketCI components. The infrastructure created by these Terraform scripts provides the underlying platform on which KubeRocketCI operates, enabling continuous integration, continuous delivery, and DevOps automation.
